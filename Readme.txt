This repository is the home for one of my idle projects. The premise is for me to develop a deeper understanding of linked lists than I see in many of my classes. Anyone who stumbles upon this, and has an understanding that I seem to be lacking, constructive criticism is appreciated. The long term goal of this is to re-write the STL, and eventually optimize for efficiency. I plan to eventually package this all within an api. If this becomes useful to someone down the line, please attribute credit, but this software is available freely.

Changelog:

2015/12/31
Scrapped all prior code. Templatized and renamed the doubly linked list class. List can be pushed and popped from front and back. New test .cpp file. Fixed memory leaks and bugs from prior version (0.1). Now requires C++11 for nullptr to shift away from NULL macro from C as it becomes depreciated.
