This repository is the home for one of my idle projects. The premise is for me to develop a deeper understanding of linked lists than I see in many of my classes. Anyone who stumbles upon this, and has an understanding that I seem to be lacking, constructive criticism is appreciated. The long term goal of this is to re-write the STL, and eventually optimize for efficiency. I plan to eventually package this all within an api. If this becomes useful to someone down the line, please attribute credit, but this software is available freely.
